This project took me about 3 real time hours to do. About an hour to do the html, another to do the css, and then one hour trying to figure out how to make the quote not squeeze into a two letter column. I resolved that by realizing that I shouldn't use padding to make background color maintain parity with the rest of the webpage, and should let flex do its own thing. I did this by just creating another flex container that contained a set width quote. From there everything seemed fine. This was a fun little project and I really enjoyed it, it helped me realize what I did all on my own. Of course I did not forget that lists have margins that need to be reset, never forget that.
